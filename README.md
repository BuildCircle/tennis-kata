### Overview

We want to create an app that tracks a game of tennis between two players, eventually calculating the winner. The aim is to build out the below requirements one by one, using tests to drive our code.

### Requirements

- The game takes two names on startup, indicating player one and player two.
- Each player should start with a score of zero.
- When a player wins a round, the user inputs their name into the command line, and their score increases.
- The game should be won by the first player to reach a score of at least 4 points and be ahead of their opponent by at least 2 points (make sure to handle all the edge cases!).
- If a player has won, an exception should be thrown if they try playing another round.
- Are there any other edge cases you can think of?
